Nice to talk to you again. The smart tip I can't see in preview mode is called 'Create Sales Quote - Side Form Tips'.



 ![](https://whatfix.zendesk.com/attachments/token/oJ1dYw0U78JlPjPRYz1EDxIwP/?name=image.png)



What I'm expecting to see when I preview is this smart tip on delivery name:

However, in preview mode, the smart tip is not showing on the delivery name textbox.

Any suggestions would be welcome.



Thanks,

Upon investigating the issue with the Smart Tip, I found that the element’s properties were dynamically changing when hovering over the tip. This behaviour caused the tip to repeatedly disappear and reappear after the tooltip vanished, creating a recursive loop.

To resolve this, I applied a CSS selector to stabilise the Smart Tip. The updated version has been moved to the **Ready** stage.I also noticed a similar issue with the Smart Tip titled ""**Grade**” and I have applied the same fix to that tip as well.

Please test both tips on your end and let me know if everything is working as expected or if you face any further issues. I'm happy to assist further if needed.
